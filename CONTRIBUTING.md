# Contributing to ConnectED

Welcome to ConnectED! We're excited that you're interested in contributing to our modern education platform. This guide will help you get started with contributing to the project.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: v18.x or v20.x (download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/))
- **npm**: Comes with Node.js
- **Git**: For version control
- **Docker**: For containerization (optional, for development)
- **MongoDB**: For local development (optional, Docker provides this)

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   # Fork on GitHub, then clone your fork
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/connected.git
   cd connected
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

4. **Start MongoDB and Redis (using Docker)**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d mongodb redis
   ```

5. **Build CSS assets**
   ```bash
   npm run build:css
   ```

6. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

7. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## 🛠 Development Workflow

### 1. Creating a Feature Branch

Always create a new branch for your work:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
# or
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-bug
```

### 2. Making Changes

- Follow the [Development Standards](DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS.md)
- Write tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Ensure all tests pass: `npm test`
- Check code style: `npm run lint`

### 3. Committing Changes

Follow conventional commit messages:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication endpoint"

# For breaking changes
git commit -m "feat: redesign user API

BREAKING CHANGE: User API endpoints have changed structure"

# For fixes
git commit -m "fix: resolve memory leak in cache service"
```

### 4. Pushing and Creating Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub with:
- Clear title and description
- Reference any related issues
- Screenshots for UI changes
- Testing instructions

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

### Writing Tests

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and methods
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain 80%+ coverage

Example test structure:
```javascript
describe('UserService', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup test data
  });

  afterEach(() => {
    // Cleanup
  });

  it('should create user successfully', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

## 🔒 Security

### Security Guidelines

- Never commit sensitive data (passwords, API keys)
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Follow security best practices in code
- Run security scans: `npm run security-scan`

### Reporting Security Issues

If you find a security vulnerability, please:
1. Do NOT create a public issue
2. Email security@connected.edu
3. Include detailed reproduction steps
4. We will respond within 48 hours

## 📝 Documentation

### When to Update Documentation

- New features or API endpoints
- Changes to existing functionality
- Setup or installation changes
- Breaking changes

### Documentation Structure

- **README.md**: Project overview and setup
- **API_DOCUMENTATION.md**: API reference
- **DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS.md**: Development guidelines
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: This file
- Inline code comments for complex logic

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

### Automated Checks

All PRs must pass:
- ✅ Unit and integration tests
- ✅ Code linting (ESLint + Prettier)
- ✅ Security scanning
- ✅ Performance tests
- ✅ Code coverage requirements

### Branch Protection

- **main**: Requires 2 approvals, all checks pass
- **develop**: Requires 1 approval, main checks pass
- **feature branches**: Basic checks, 1 approval

## 🚢 Deployment

### Development Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to development environment
./scripts/deploy.sh development

# Check health
./scripts/health-check.sh
```

### Production Deployment

```bash
# Create backup first
./scripts/backup.sh production

# Deploy to production
./scripts/deploy.sh production v1.2.3

# Verify deployment
./scripts/health-check.sh https://connected.edu
```

## 🐛 Debugging

### Common Issues

1. **Port already in use**
   ```bash
   # Find and kill process using port 3000
   lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
   ```

2. **MongoDB connection issues**
   ```bash
   # Check MongoDB status
   docker-compose ps mongodb
   # View MongoDB logs
   docker-compose logs mongodb
   ```

3. **Test database issues**
   ```bash
   # Reset test database
   npm run test:setup
   ```

### Debugging Tools

- **Application Logs**: Check console output
- **Database**: Use MongoDB Compass or command line
- **Redis**: Use Redis Commander or redis-cli
- **Network**: Use browser dev tools or curl
